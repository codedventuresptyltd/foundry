# About The Foundry

The Foundry is where Coded Ventures builds in the open. It's more than documentation — it's our public engineering forge organized into three distinct spaces:

**1. Documentation** — Structured, formal records of how our frameworks work. Architecture diagrams, Bridge APIs, engagement models, integration philosophy, and roadmaps for CommerceBridge, Touchpoint, Eidos, and Mesh.

**2. Engineering Journal** — Long-form writing capturing how and why we make decisions. Essays like "Why we model commerce as Engagements, not Orders" or "The evolution of Worker Ecosystems." Think of it as our engineering blog tied to a living product ecosystem.

**3. Research Commons** — A space for deeper exploration, early prototypes, architectural sketches, and "what if" experiments. Conceptual design notes and discussion threads with thoughtful marginalia for engineers.

Together, these spaces explain how our systems work, why they're designed that way, and how others can connect to them.

## About Coded Ventures

Coded Ventures builds **composable, intelligent frameworks for commerce and automation**. Our mission is to create systems that are:

- **Composable** — modular components that work together seamlessly
- **Intelligent** — leveraging AI and smart orchestration where it matters
- **Scalable** — built for multi-tenant, distributed architectures
- **Transparent** — clear design principles you can understand and extend

Foundry is the public home for architectural overviews, SDK references, and integration guides for our ecosystem.

## Our Frameworks

### [CommerceBridge](/commercebridge)
**The Framework That Orchestrates Commerce**

A sophisticated orchestration layer that models commerce as engagements, not just orders. CommerceBridge connects workers, manages state, handles integrations, and provides the backbone for modern B2B commerce systems.

- Worker ecosystems and distributed processing
- Engagement-centric design patterns
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Extensible integration framework

### [Touchpoint](/touchpoint)
**Dynamic Ordering Experiences for Trade & Industry**

Modern, slot-based UI framework for building configurable ordering experiences. Touchpoint provides both admin and storefront layers that deeply integrate with CommerceBridge.

- Slot-based, composable UI components
- Admin and customer-facing experiences
- Real-time pricing and availability
- Customizable workflows

### [Eidos](/eidos)
**Structured Knowledge for Configurable Products**

A system for defining product DNA and business rules. Eidos models the genetic makeup of products, enabling sophisticated configuration, pricing, and fulfillment logic.

- Product schema definitions
- Rule-based configuration
- Integration with pricing and fulfillment
- Extensible attribute models

- **[Engagement-Centric Design](/core/engagement-centric-design)** — Commerce as conversations

### Commerce Concepts

- **[Pricing Models](/core/pricing-models)** — Multi-stage pricing with modifiers
- **[Caching Strategies](/core/caching-strategies)** — Multi-layer performance optimization
- **[Fulfillment](/core/fulfillment)** — Multi-warehouse delivery orchestration

### Operations

- **[Security](/core/security)** — Defense-in-depth approach
- **[DevOps Philosophy](/core/devops-philosophy)** — Evolving ecosystems

### Reference

- **[Models & Types](/core/models)** — Core data structures defined

## Field Notes

Occasionally we publish narratives, essays, and updates from the engineering trenches:

- Notes on building distributed worker systems
- Why we model commerce as engagements, not orders
- Designing for autonomy in multi-tenant architectures
- Real-world lessons from production systems

## Philosophy

> **Engineering craftsmanship meets clear design thinking.**

We believe in:

- **Building in the open** — sharing the shape of our systems, not the secrets
- **Crafted precision** — thoughtful design over marketing hype
- **Calm confidence** — we don't need to shout about what we build
- **Learning in public** — documenting not just how, but why

---

**Welcome to the forge. Let's build something remarkable.**
