# Core Concepts

**Cross-Platform Ideas and Reusable Philosophies**

Beyond individual products, Coded Ventures has developed a set of architectural patterns, design philosophies, and engineering principles that transcend any single framework. These core concepts inform how we build systems and can be applied across different domains.

---

## Overview

Our core concepts span three main areas:

### Architecture Patterns

Distributed systems design and abstraction:

- **[Worker Ecosystems](/core/worker-ecosystems)** — Distributed, autonomous processing systems
- **[Bridge Architecture](/core/bridge-architecture)** — Central abstraction layer between workers and integrations
- **[Engagement-Centric Design](/core/engagement-centric-design)** — Modeling commerce as conversations, not transactions
- **[Engagements](/core/engagements)** — Lifecycle containers for commerce conversations
- **[Translator Framework](/core/translators)** — Modular translation layer for external data formats

### Commerce Concepts

Domain-specific patterns for B2B commerce:

- **[Pricing](/core/pricing-models)** — Flexible rule-based pricing engine
- **[Datastores](/core/caching-strategies)** — Data sinks that buffer and synchronize between systems
- **[Fulfillment](/core/fulfillment)** — Intelligent inventory allocation and delivery orchestration

### Operations

Running and scaling distributed systems:

- **[Security](/core/security)** — Defense-in-depth security approach
- **[DevOps Philosophy](/core/devops-philosophy)** — "Starve old workers, evolve ecosystems"

### Reference

- **[Models & Types](/core/models)** — Core data structures defined

## Architecture Patterns

### [Worker Ecosystems](/core/worker-ecosystems)

**Distributed, autonomous processing systems**

Workers are stateless, replaceable processing engines that form ecosystems. They:

- Scale elastically based on workload
- Specialize or generalize as needed
- Retire gracefully when superseded
- Communicate through message queues
- Maintain no persistent state

Key principles:
- "Starve old workers, evolve ecosystems"
- Workers are cattle, not pets
- Failure is expected and handled gracefully
- Deploy new versions, let old ones drain

### [Bridge Architecture](/core/bridge-architecture)

**Central abstraction layer between workers and integrations**

The Bridge provides a common application interface that abstracts integrations. Workers call Bridge functions instead of directly accessing databases, APIs, or external systems.

The Bridge handles:
- State management and coordination
- Shared integrations (messaging, payments, shipping, ERPs)
- Multi-tenant resource coordination
- Access control and security

Key principles:
- Workers call Bridge functions, not external systems directly
- Common API interface abstracts integration complexity
- Extend the Bridge to add your integrations
- Clean separation between processing logic and integration logic

### [Engagement-Centric Design](/core/engagement-centric-design)

**Modeling commerce as conversations, not transactions**

Traditional systems model orders as the primary entity. We model **engagements**:

- Engagements represent the full lifecycle
- State persists across the entire journey
- Multiple orders can exist within one engagement
- Context and history are first-class citizens
- Interactions are traceable and auditable

This pattern applies beyond commerce to any multi-step, stateful process.

### [Translator Framework](/core/translators)

**Modular translation layer for external data formats**

The Translator Framework provides a standardized way to serialize Engagements into external formats like cXML, UBL, and custom schemas. Built on three components:

- **Config** — Declarative field mappings
- **Transformer** — Data extraction and normalization logic
- **Template** — Format output definition

Key principles:
- Register translators dynamically by format and version
- Tenant-specific overrides without code changes
- Clean separation between data, logic, and presentation
- Type-safe transformations with validation

## Commerce Concepts

These concepts are implemented across CommerceBridge, Touchpoint, and Eidos to handle complex B2B commerce scenarios.
