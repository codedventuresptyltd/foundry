# OpenAI Integration

AI-powered intelligence for engagement generation, order management, and worker creation.

## Modules Provided

### Engagement Builder Module

**Capabilities:**
- Generate engagements from natural language
- Parse order requests
- Extract structured data
- Validate completeness

**Use Cases:**
- Email-to-order conversion
- Voice-to-order processing
- Chat-based ordering
- Auto-quoting

### OMS Intelligence Module

**Capabilities:**
- Order intent classification
- Priority scoring
- Issue detection
- Recommendation generation

**Use Cases:**
- Order routing
- Priority assignment
- Anomaly detection
- Smart suggestions

### Worker Builder Module

**Capabilities:**
- Generate worker code
- Template selection
- Code validation
- Worker documentation

**Use Cases:**
- Rapid worker prototyping
- Worker scaffolding
- Code generation
- Development automation

## Configuration

```typescript
OPENAI_API_KEY=<from-secrets>
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.1
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=2000
```

## Bridge Access

```typescript
// Generate engagement from text
const engagement = await bridge.integrations.openAi.engagementBuilder
  .generateFromText({
    text: "I need 100 units of SKU-123 delivered to Chicago",
    context: { customerId, tenantId }
  });

// OMS intelligence
const analysis = await bridge.integrations.openAi.oms.analyzeOrder({
  engagement,
  history: customerOrders
});

// Generate worker
const workerCode = await bridge.integrations.openAi.workerBuilder
  .generateWorker({
    description: "Process inventory updates",
    template: "data-processor"
  });
```

## Use Cases

**Natural Language Ordering:** Convert customer messages into structured orders.

**Intelligent Routing:** Classify and route orders based on content analysis.

**Development Acceleration:** Generate worker boilerplate from descriptions.

**Data Extraction:** Parse unstructured data into engagement fields.

## Advantages

**Intelligence:** Understand context and intent, not just keywords.

**Flexibility:** Handle variations and unexpected inputs gracefully.

**Speed:** Process requests in seconds, not minutes.

**Accuracy:** High-quality structured output from unstructured input.

## Operational Notes

### Cost Management
- Cache common requests
- Use appropriate model for task
- Set token limits
- Monitor API usage

### Reliability
- Implement retries
- Handle rate limits
- Fallback to manual processing
- Validate AI output

### Security
- No sensitive data in prompts
- Sanitize inputs
- Validate outputs
- Audit AI decisions

## When to Use

**Unstructured Input:** When you need to parse natural language into structured data.

**Intelligence Layer:** When rule-based systems aren't flexible enough.

**Development Tools:** When you want to accelerate development with code generation.

## When NOT to Use

**Deterministic Logic:** Use regular code for predictable, deterministic operations.

**High-Volume:** AI calls have cost - use for value-add operations only.

**Real-Time Critical:** AI responses have latency - not for sub-second requirements.
