# Welcome to the Foundry

Today we're launching **Foundry** — the public engineering forge for Coded Ventures.

Foundry isn't just documentation. It's where we share how we build, why we make certain design decisions, and how others can connect to our frameworks.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why Build in the Open?

Over the years, we've developed sophisticated systems for B2B commerce, distributed processing, and configurable products. These systems embody patterns and principles that we believe are worth sharing.

We're not open-sourcing everything (yet), but we can share the **shape** of our systems — the architectural decisions, the patterns we've discovered, the lessons we've learned.

## What You'll Find Here

### Product Documentation

- **CommerceBridge** — our commerce orchestration framework
- **Touchpoint** — dynamic ordering experiences for trade and industry
- **Eidos** — structured knowledge for configurable products

Each product section includes architectural overviews, integration guides, and SDK references.

### Core Concepts

Cross-platform ideas that apply beyond any single product:

- Worker ecosystems and distributed processing
- Engagement-centric design patterns
- Multi-tenant architecture strategies
- DevOps philosophy ("Starve old workers, evolve ecosystems")

### Field Notes

This section — engineering narratives, design decisions, and lessons from production systems. Think of it as our engineering journal, published periodically.

## The Forge Metaphor

We chose "Foundry" deliberately. A foundry is where raw materials are transformed through heat and pressure into something useful and enduring.

That's how we approach software:

- **Heat** — the pressure of real-world requirements
- **Craft** — careful design and implementation
- **Iteration** — refining through use and feedback
- **Durability** — building systems that last

## Engineering Craftsmanship

Our approach combines:

- **Calm confidence** — we don't need to shout about what we build
- **Clear thinking** — obvious code over clever tricks
- **Pragmatic choices** — ship working solutions, iterate based on reality
- **Open learning** — document not just how, but why

## What's Next?

We'll be gradually filling in documentation across all sections. Priorities:

1. **CommerceBridge architecture deep-dive** — how the Bridge, Workers, and Engagements fit together
2. **Worker ecosystem patterns** — building distributed, autonomous systems
3. **Pricing engine internals** — multi-stage modifiers and caching strategies
4. **Touchpoint customization guide** — extending the slot-based UI

We'll also publish Field Notes periodically on topics like:

- Why we model commerce as engagements, not orders
- Lessons from building multi-tenant distributed systems
- The evolution of our DevOps philosophy
- Real-world tradeoffs in system design

## Join the Conversation

Foundry is a living resource. If you're building similar systems, integrating with our frameworks, or just curious about our approach, we'd love to hear from you.

Check back regularly as we continue to document, refine, and share.
